It comments on how fast fashion has increased and we have clothes-trashing cities, accumulating clothes that are both not fastly biodegradable nor reusable. The documentary also interviews americans who worked at large companies and shares how companies are driven by money. Their profit is based on how to make users buy more (not what they need or if they need) regardless of the trash being produced by this fast-eady-buy system.",

The story setup keeps us wondering why the best physicists would commit suicide with death notes saying they don't believe in physics and what's the scientific explanation for people to see countdowns in their visions. The mystery and twists are very creative and nothing like I've seen before. Amazing to the point that it got me reading the book. So far, I can tell that it's wonderful to have the videogame scenes in audiovisual.",

The friends don't add much to the story and their characters' development towards an end road is uninteresting and dragging.
