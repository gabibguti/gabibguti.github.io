      "weak-points": "The show pictures five friends, among them scientists, that get tangled in the local deaths mystery. The friends don't add much to the story and their characters' development towards an end road is uninteresting and dragging. For me, the worst episodes are regarding the friend that has a terminal disease and they end up taking his brain and sending it across space in a failing mission. Sort of funny though. Anyways, personally, I prefer the book that pictures a single scientist and the story happens around him.",
